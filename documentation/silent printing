Silent printing from the browser can be done from chrome using the following:

chrome shortcut launches using kiosk printing mode
example:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --kiosk-printing "https://pizzapro-swhc.c9users.io/orders/custsearch"

the print dialog will appear and then immediately disappear
this does require having the default printer set to the receipt printer
